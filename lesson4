dns - 
hosts (file) - Mac /etc/hosts - applies to machine
decentralised & hierarchical

dig - dns lookup utlitity

dig +short www.realestate.com.au
cname = canonical name (pointer)
'A' record = address
dig www.realestate.com.au
root zone (highest in hierarchy)
root -> leaf nodes

dig @8.8.8.8 NS realestate.com.au. (NS = name service/server)

. (dot) is root .... e.g. au.
whois <ipaddress> or <name>
tells you 'who' owns the address
TLD = top level domain e.g. .com

.au servers are only responsible for .au domains (only in next level)

recursive dns server will query the hierachy (not all are recursive)

root = not recursive (to only respond to their zone, otherwise overloaded with all requests)

local dns is recursive (e.g. one in building 10.x.x.x)

to initially look up root servers, local DNS knows the root hints file


homework 

....install & run DNS on EC2 instance
install name server - BIND nameserver

configure to resolve host names to ip address

register domain <any name> (not through Amazon)
